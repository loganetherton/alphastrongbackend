The backend of the alphanumeric string retrieval example follows established ExpressJS patterns and does not deviate much. The backend itself is written in TypeScript, as I believe that node APIs benefit greatly from establishing data structures and maintaining type safety throughout.

A configuration file is put in place to allow for the application to behave differently if run in `development`, `staging`, `testing`, or `production` modes.

The application is bootstrapped in `src/app.ts`, which in turn initiates the application routes, found in `src/routes.ts`. The routes each call a controller, which handles the routing and determines the response of various calls to the API.

A basic `ErrorLog` and `Log` are established will log all incoming requests (except for `GET` and `OPTIONS`, as those are typically unnecessary for logging, except for the case of debugging performance problems). The important route, found in `src/controllers/alpha.ts` simply returns the requested string immediately.

Controller route functions all call the `next()` parameter, which will pass errors to a global error handler, found in `server.ts`. This will log all uncaught exceptions, and can be used for future debugging.
